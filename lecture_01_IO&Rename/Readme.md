
### Problem Statement
**Task:**
Write a C++ program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum.
2. Calculates the square root of the sum.
3. The program must include class and object structure to perform the above tasks.


### Solution Outline
The solution is broken into three files:
1. **SumSqrt.h** - Header file that defines the `SumSqrt` class, which contains private variables and public methods for calculating the sum and square root.
2. **SumSqrt.cpp** - Implementation of the class methods.
3. **main.cpp** - The main driver file that creates an instance of the `SumSqrt` class, invokes methods, and interacts with the user.

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Class and Object Structure:** Learn to encapsulate related functionality into a class and perform operations using objects.
2. **Input/Output in C++:** Get hands-on experience with handling user input and producing output.
3. **Mathematical Operations:** Utilize the C++ math library (`<cmath>`) to perform advanced calculations such as square roots.
4. **Constructor and Methods:** Understand how to initialize object properties via constructors and utilize methods to perform tasks.

### Input and Output
- **Input:** The user will be prompted to enter two numbers.
- **Output:** 
  1. The sum of the two numbers.
  2. The square root of the sum (if applicable).

#### Example:

**Input:**
```bash
Enter two numbers:
4
9
```

**Output:**
```bash
Sum of 4 and 9 is: 13
Square root of the sum is: 3.60555
```
